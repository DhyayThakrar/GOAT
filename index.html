        <h1>Determining the Greatest of All Time in All of Sports</h1>
        <h2>By Dhyay Thakrar and Jeffery Meredith</h2>
        <p>
            Everyone has wondered who the greatest of all time is in all of sports. 
            For each sport, people have their own GOAT like LeBron James or Michael Jordan for basketball, Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo
             for soccer, or Michael Phelps for swimming. But you might be thinking who is the stands out at the top when we compare all the sports?
             Maybe you think it is Usain Bolt or Roger Federer or Muhammad Ali. Today, we are in the quest of determining who is the Greatest of All 
             Time in All the Sports.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            To determine which player is the greatest, we believe they should be competing in the toughest sport. We will analyse several 
            attributes of 60 of the most renowned sports in  the world to determine which is the toughest. By giving all the attributes equal
            importance, we have come to the conclusion that Basketball, Boxing, Wrestling, Football and Ice Hockey are the 5 toughest sports 
            in the world. The radar chart below showcases these sports and the how much of each attribute is required for it.
